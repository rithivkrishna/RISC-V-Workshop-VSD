# Week 1
## Set up the RISC-V development environment using GitHub Codespaces, verified all required tools, and executed sample programs using both native GCC and RISC-V GCC with the Spike simulator. I also explored the noVNC Linux desktop, edited programs using a GUI editor, and confirmed correct execution, completing the full setup and initial RISC-V workflow.

### LAB 1
#### Wrote and executed a C program in Linux to calculate the sum of numbers up to a given value n, and verified the correct output through compilation and execution.

### LAB 2
#### Converted the C program into RISC-V assembly and executed it on the RISC-V simulator, obtaining the same output and verifying correct instruction-level behavior.

### LAB 3
#### Tested the program using both signed and unsigned integers, comparing the results to understand data representation and ensure correct behavior in each case.
