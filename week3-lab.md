# Week 3 
##  Learnt to use Makerchip and worked extensively with TL-Verilog, completing all assignments using the tool to design, simulate, and verify our implementations.

### LAB 1
#### Implemented and tested an inverter along with all basic logic gates, gaining hands-on experience with their operation and verification.

### LAB 2
#### Performed vector operations on binary numbers, implementing and verifying arithmetic and logical operations to understand bit-level data processing.
