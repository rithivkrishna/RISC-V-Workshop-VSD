# Week 3 
##  Learnt to use Makerchip and worked extensively with TL-Verilog, completing all assignments using the tool to design, simulate, and verify our implementations.

### LAB 1
#### Implemented and tested an inverter along with all basic logic gates, gaining hands-on experience with their operation and verification.

### LAB 3
#### Designed and tested multiplexers, verifying correct data selection based on control signals and understanding their role in digital system design and Implemented vector-based multiplexers, performing vector operations to select and route multi-bit data correctly based on control signals.

### LAB 6
#### Designed a multifunction adder unit where, on reset, both inputs are forced to zero; otherwise, the output is selected through a multiplexer to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the control signals.
