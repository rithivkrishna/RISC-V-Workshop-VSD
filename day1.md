Day 1

On Day 1, a cloud-based RISC-V development environment was set up using GitHub Codespaces. The RISC-V GCC toolchain, Spike simulator, and Icarus Verilog were verified, and a sample C program was successfully compiled and executed on both the native system and the RISC-V simulator. A GUI Linux desktop via noVNC was also used for editing and running programs, establishing the foundation for further RISC-V and hardware development.
